      " The Insurance Risk and Finance Research Centre of Nanyang Business School is hosting a multi-year Cyber Risk Management (CyRiM) Project. CyRiM is a three-year Public-Private Partnership sponsored by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) of Singapore, as well as leading global insurance and information security companies. The project aims to develop data and analytical tools that will enable business solutions to help corporations implement efficient and effective cybersecurity measures. A key outcome of the project will be the establishment and ongoing support of an independent database of data breach incidents, vulnerability and economic loss data, with a focus on the Asia-Pacific region.�� The project has a large research component requiring a strong link with academia that is achieved at an international level through collaborations with universities world-wide The post-doctoral positions are expected to have 2-year duration, starting in Spring or Fall of 2018. The candidate is expected to contribute to the ongoing research efforts in cyber risk management and financing of catastrophe risks, and to publish academic papers in high-quality actuarial science, risk management and insurance, business and finance journals.

    "\n",
    "Using the job postings you scraped for part 1 (or potentially new job postings from a second round of scraping), identify features in the data related to job postings that can distinguish job titles from each other. There are a variety of interesting ways you can frame the target variable, for example:\n",
    "- What components of a job posting distinguish data scientists from other data jobs?\n",
    "- What features are important for distinguishing junior vs. senior positions?\n",
    "- Do the requirements for titles vary significantly with industry (e.g. healthcare vs. government)?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may end up making multiple classification models to tackle different questions. Be sure to clearly explain your hypotheses and framing, any feature engineering, and what your target variables are. The type of classification model you choose is up to you. Be sure to interpret your results and evaluate your models' performance.\n"

    "The utimate goal is to predict the annual salary based on the available features. In order to get the target y, I had to prepare for it first, as the scrapped salaries are joined together in a single string  with min, max amount and whether the amount is in monthly or annually basis (example 6000to10000monthly, 120000to180000annually). So I had to split and give each part to its own column, then multiply x12 for those in monthly based, and consolidate to a new Annual_median column. For the above example, we will 6000 + 10000 and divide by 2 for the median. So annual median column is done. \n",
    "\n",
    "I had to split the dataset to 2, one with annual median salary that can be our train set, which will be further split as test set. Whereas the other set without salary info will be our prediction set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the target is properly defined, we will focus on train set feature X. Since it is a prediction of numbers, my first attempt is to use regression. However,the X features are all in text. So it is time to use the new skill learn from the course, yes, NLP. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we learn is to tokenize the text. What it means is to separate the text into untis such as sentences or words. Then the words need to be encoded as integers or floating point values for use as input to a machine learning algorithm. We call this process feature extraction, also known as vectorization. This is when NLTL package comes in. NLTK feature extraction module comes with 3 very common vectorizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) CountVectorizer: to convert text to word count vectors .\n",
    "2) TfidfVectorizer : to convert text to word frequency vectors.\n",
    "3) HashingVectorizer : to convert text to unique integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each have it's own stop word ability. Stop word is a list of words which its meaning has no effect to the meaning of the context. These words are stored in a list, and the vectorizer is smart enough to remove them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next feature that the vectorizer have is ngram. I put 1 to 2 settings. This is telling the vectorizer to put maximum 2 words together then do the counting on it as a whole. Of course I could have put 3 or 4, not only that the score drops, the 3 words combined don't make any sense. For example ngram=4, \"research capabilities shared sensor\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with stop words, ngram applied to all 3 vectorizor, the regresion score appears to be terrible. So I decided to try stemming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming unnecessarily chops of \"es\", \"is\" which somehow removed the meaning for some of the words, example \"analysis\" becomes \"analys\". For this reason, I did not apply it on vectorizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next I tried Lemmatizer. It properly uses vocab and morphological analyses the word, usually produces very good retrieval. After applying, the socre jumps to 0.42. This is a good sign. \n",
    "\n",
    "I did run back and forth changing the param and adding new stop words, but without any improvement. I have even tried to apply ALL the regression I know, example lasso, ridge, decisiontree, support vector, random forest, gridient boost, bagging with all regressor in, as well as adaboost. None of them gives any good score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That is when I realized, it could be due to regression's assumption. For regression to work, the relationship between independent and depentent varible must be linear. I did not check this and jump into regression is a grave mistake. But a good one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I tried classification technique. Same thing, we need to prepare y target. I binned the salary into 4 bins, according to the distribution, so that all class is balanced. \n",
    "\n",
    "After y target is defined, and apply it to countvectorizer cum lemmatized words, stop word, ngram 1,2, into logistic regression, decisiontress, and multinomial navie bayes. The score highest achieved is only 0.48 from tfid logistic regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this score, although not good enough, I used it to predict the Annual_medium anyway. You can see the df_predict.Annual_medium at the end (initially there is no value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I shopped question 1.\n",
